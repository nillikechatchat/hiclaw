# Model Switch

Switch the Manager's own LLM model. The script tests connectivity first, then patches `openclaw.json`.

## Usage

```bash
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/model-switch/scripts/update-manager-model.sh <MODEL_ID> [--context-window <SIZE>] [--no-reasoning]
```

Examples:
```bash
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/model-switch/scripts/update-manager-model.sh claude-sonnet-4-6
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/model-switch/scripts/update-manager-model.sh my-custom-model --context-window 300000
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/model-switch/scripts/update-manager-model.sh deepseek-chat --no-reasoning
```

## What the script does

1. Strips any `hiclaw-gateway/` prefix from the model name
2. Tests the model via `POST /v1/chat/completions` on the AI Gateway — exits with error if unreachable
3. If the model is already in the `models` array: switches `agents.defaults.model.primary` (hot-reload, ~300ms)
4. If the model is new: adds it to the `models` array and switches primary, outputs `RESTART_REQUIRED`

## After running the script

Check the script output:
- If the output contains `RESTART_REQUIRED`, tell the human admin: **"The model has been added to the configuration, but a restart of the Manager container is needed for it to take effect."**
- Otherwise the switch is immediate, no further action needed.

## Reasoning control

By default, reasoning (extended thinking) is enabled. To disable it, pass `--no-reasoning`.

## On failure

If the gateway test fails (non-200), the script prints an error with details. No changes are made to `openclaw.json` in this case.

## Important

**NEVER use `session_status` tool to change the model** — that only affects the current session temporarily and does not persist. Always use this script.

## Switching to an unknown model

When the human admin requests switching to a model you don't recognize, you MUST:

1. **Ask the admin two questions** before running the script:
   - "This model is not in the known list. What is its context window size (in tokens)?"
   - "Does this model support reasoning (extended thinking)?"
2. Run the script with the appropriate flags:
   ```bash
   bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/model-switch/scripts/update-manager-model.sh <MODEL_ID> --context-window <SIZE> [--no-reasoning]
   ```
3. If the admin does not know the context window, use the default (150,000) by omitting `--context-window`.
4. If the model does not support reasoning, add `--no-reasoning`.
