# Worker Selection (Step 0)

**Trigger**: Admin gives a task without naming a Worker.

## Find available workers

```bash
# All workers with full availability info
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/find-worker.sh

# Filter by required skills
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/task-management/scripts/find-worker.sh --skills github-operations,git-delegation
```

Output includes `summary` (idle/busy/stopped/unavailable counts) and `workers` array with: `availability`, `role` (from SOUL.md), `skills`, `finite_tasks`, `infinite_tasks`, `active_tasks`, `container_status`.

## Decision flow (delegation-first)

1. **Idle workers exist** → pick best match by role + skills, present as Option A (strongly recommended)
2. **Only busy workers** → present workload info, suggest Option B (create new Worker) or wait
3. **No workers at all** → suggest Option B. Only fall back to Option C if admin explicitly requests it

Options:
- **Option A** (preferred) — Assign to idle Worker
- **Option B** — Create a new Worker (suggest name/role/skills/model)
- **Option C** (last resort) — Handle yourself. Only when admin explicitly says "do it yourself" or task is within your management skills (worker-management, mcp-server-management, model-switch)

Act on choice: A → ensure container ready then assign; B → create Worker then assign; C → work directly (no task directory needed).

**Skip Step 0 when**: admin names a Worker, says "do it yourself", or it's a heartbeat-triggered infinite task. In YOLO mode, the admin is unavailable — autonomously pick the best Worker or create one without asking.

## Before assigning: container readiness

The `find-worker.sh` output already includes `container_status` and `availability`:

- `idle` or `busy` → container running, assign directly
- `stopped` → wake up first: `lifecycle-worker.sh --action ensure-ready --worker <name>`
- `unavailable` → try `ensure-ready` first (attempts recreate); if `status=failed`, notify admin to recreate via `create-worker.sh`

If you already ran `find-worker.sh`, do NOT run a separate container check. Only run standalone check when assigning to an explicitly named Worker (Step 0 was skipped).

## Skills API URL (only when creating a new Worker)

Check default: `echo "${HICLAW_SKILLS_API_URL}"`

`find-skills` is a builtin skill (always available). Optionally ask admin for a custom registry URL and pass to `create-worker.sh` via `--skills-api-url`.
